The preferred contribution method is through GitHub Pull Requests at the moment, though this is subject to change if the repository is removed from GitHub. Alternatively, you can discuss the additions you wish to see with me through email (<1305@national.shitposting.agency>) or in the "EchoVR Custom Servers" Discord chatroom and I may add them myself, crediting you in the AUTHORS file.

Adding your contact information to the AUTHORS file under the contributors section is the default, unless you specifically state that you do not wish for your name to be added into the file for any reason.

When contributing any changes, following the [Conventional Commits v1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) guidelines for your Git commits is highly encouraged, but *is not a requirement*.

Lastly, if you contribute to this project, you agree to allow redistribution of your contributions as permitted in the LICENSE file.
