The preferred contribution method is through GitHub Pull Requests at the moment. Alternatively, you can discuss the additions you wish to see with me through email (<1305@national.shitposting.agency>) or in the *"EchoVR Custom Servers"* Discord chatroom and I may add them myself, crediting you in the AUTHORS file.

Adding your contact information to the AUTHORS file under the contributors section is standard, unless you explicitly state that you do not wish to be credited.

When contributing any changes, following the [Conventional Commits v1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) guidelines for your Git commits is highly encouraged, but *is not a requirement*.

Lastly, if you contribute to this project, you agree to allow redistribution of your contributions as permitted under LICENSE.md.
